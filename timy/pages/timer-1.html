            <h1>Pomodoro Technique</h1>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique was invented by <b>Francesco Cirillo </b>, an Italian entrepreneur, developer, and author. <br>
            Francesco Cirillo developed the technique in the late 1980s while he was a university student. He found that
            breaking his work into short, timed intervals helped him stay focused and productive. <br>
            Cirillo named the technique after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer he used to track his work intervals. <br>
            The Pomodoro Technique has become a popular productivity tool worldwide and is used by students,
            professionals, and anyone looking to manage their time more effectively. It's especially helpful for tasks that require
            sustained concentration and can be adapted to suit individual needs by adjusting the length of Pomodoros and breaks <br>
            This method is a simple yet powerful tool for improving focus, managing time, and reducing procrastination,
            making it a widely adopted technique in various fields.</p>
