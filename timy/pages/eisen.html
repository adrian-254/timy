        <h1>EisenHower Matrix</h1>
        <p>It is a time management tool that helps you prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance.
        It was popularized by <b> Dwight D. Eisenhower</b>,the 34th President of the United States, 
        who was known for his effective time management skills. <br> The matrix is divided into four quadrants,
        each representing a different combination of urgency and importance:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important (Do First)</b> <br> <b>Tasks:</b>These are tasks that require immediate attention and have 
            significant consequences if not completed promptly.
            Examples include crises, deadlines, and pressing problems. <br> <b>Actions:</b>These tasks should be your top priority. 
            Focus on completing them as soon as possible.</li>
            <li><b>Quadrant 2: Not Urgent but Important (Schedule)</b> <br> <b>Tasks:</b>These are important tasks that contribute to your long-term
            goals but do not require immediate action.Examples include planning, personal development, relationship building, and strategic work.
            <br> <b>Actions:Schedule these tasks in your calendar and dedicate time to them. 
            By focusing on these tasks, you can prevent them from becoming urgent in the future.</b></li>
            <li><b>Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)</b> <br> <b>Tasks</b>These tasks demand immediate attention but do not significantly contribute to your long-term goals.
            Examples include interruptions, meetings, and tasks that others can do. <br> <b>Action:</b> Delegate these tasks to others whenever possible.
            If you can't delegate, try to minimize the time spent on them.</li>
            <li><b>Quadrant 4: Not Urgent and Not Important (Eliminate)</b><br><b>Tasks</b>These are time-wasting activities that neither contribute to your goals nor require immediate attention.
            Examples include trivial activities, excessive entertainment, and unnecessary tasks. <br><b>Actions</b>Eliminate these tasks from your schedule as much as possible. 
            They do not add value to your productivity or well-being.</li>
        </ol>

            <h4>Why it works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clear Prioritization:</b> Helps you identify which tasks need immediate attention and which can be scheduled or delegated.</li>
                <li><b>Focus on Long-Term Goals</b>Encourages you to spend more time on important, non-urgent tasks that contribute to your long-term success.</li>
                <li><b>Efficient Use of Time</b>By delegating or eliminating tasks that are not important, you free up time for more valuable activities.</li>
