               <h1>The 90-Minute Work Cycle</h1>
               <br>
               <br>
               <p>
                    The concept of the 90-minute cycle originates from sleep research conducted by <b>Nathaniel Kleitman</b>,
                    a pioneering sleep researcher. He discovered that the human sleep cycle consists of 
                    alternating periods of deep and light sleep, roughly lasting 90 minutes. 
                    This idea was later extended to waking periods, where the brain experiences
                    similar cycles of heightened focus and lower energy. <br>
                    The 90-minute work cycle is rooted in research on <b>ultradian rhythms</b>,
                    which are natural cycles that occur throughout the day, typically lasting between 90 to 120 minutes.
                    These rhythms influence various physiological and mental states, such as <b>alertness</b> , <b>energy</b>, and <b>focus.</b>

          <h4>Why It Works</h4>
          <ul>
               <li><b>Energy Alignment:</b>By working in alignment with your body’s natural energy rhythms,
                    you can sustain focus and productivity more effectively during the 90-minute period.</li>
               <li><b>Preventing Burnout:</b>The built-in break after each work cycle ensures that you don’t
                    overexert yourself, helping to maintain long-term productivity and prevent burnout.</li>
               <li><b>Improved Concentration:</b>Knowing that you only need to concentrate for a set 90-minute
                    period can help reduce procrastination and improve the quality of your work.</li>
          </ul>
