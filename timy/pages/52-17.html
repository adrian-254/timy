            <p>The specific durations of 52 minutes of work and 17 minutes of break may seem unusual,
            but they were identified as the  <b>optimal balance</b> that allowed workers to maintain high 
            levels of productivity without diminishing returns.It was created a result of empirical analysis from this study.</p>

        <h4>Why it Works</h4>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Focused Work:</b> The 52-minute work period is long enough to make meaningful progress on a task 
            but short enough to prevent fatigue or loss of focus.</li>
            <li><b>Complete Rest:</b>The 17-minute break is sufficiently long to allow for physical and mental recovery,
            enabling you to maintain high productivity levels throughout the day. 
            The break encourages activities that are unrelated to work, such as walking, stretching,
            or even socializing, which helps refresh the mind.</li>
            <li><b>Sustainable Productivity:</b>The balance between work and rest in this rule promotes sustained productivity
            over long periods, making it easier to avoid the burnout associated with longer work sessions.</li>
        </ul>
